MongoDB files are enclosed in the folder but in the event that it does not work please change the location in express ln32 to your local MongoDB

please change line 14 if you get a corse error to your local host ip address

the login,signup,index (homepage) are on local ip address but then change to local host from that point onwards so ensure a visual code live server is running and express.js

Thank you and have a lovely day
